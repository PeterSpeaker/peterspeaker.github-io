                <p>My name is Peter and I welcome you to my website.
                    I am a spiritual man and as such I have spent a considerable part of my life seeking spiritual enlightenment of some degree and the true nature of the human experience.<br></br>
                    This has inevitably led me to pursuing other areas of our existence, such things as our true history, are we alone in the universe, the pursuit of happiness plus many more subjects of great interest.
                    I have just recently published a book called “ Just a thought” which covers many of these subjects, and again that inevitably led to me wanting to share my insights through speaking.<br></br>
                    Most of my talks, dependant on the subject material, come with a power point display to support what I am conveying.<br></br>
                    I offer my talks on the basis of a 45 minute professional presentation, followed by a small break and then into a 45 minute question and answer session, this can sometimes go on longer if required.<br></br>
                    I also offer a smaller and more intermate talk along the lines of a home visitation for a small group, consisting of the 45 minute presentation followed again by a Q&A session.<br></br>
                    I have a wealth of experience in public speaking and have tried to make my talks not only humorous at times but also very interesting, educational, and something that everyone attending can leave not only feeling they had an enjoyable time but that they learnt something they had never considered before.<br></br>
                    The talks I currently offer are as follows:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Are We Alone Part A: looking into the startling evidence gathered all through history of the possibility’s we are not alone in the universe.
                            Supported with a power point display.</li>

                        <li>Are We Alone Part B: Following on from part A, this talk delves deeper into the subject of are we alone in this universe.
                            Supported with a power point display.</li>

                        <li>Issues With History: A look into the many holes that appear in our history that we have all been informed about that frankly do not hold up against our modern scientific discovers, leading to the question “ what is our true history”.
                            Supported with a power point display.</li>

                        <li>Technological Boom: This talk looks into the incredible advance’s made in our technology over the last 100-150 years and presents a possible alternative reason for what was suddenly a huge leap forward overnight, something other than the widely accepted reasoning being the natural advancement of human skills.
                            Supported with a power point display.</li>

                        <li>Our place in the Universe: This talk looks into our home planet of Earth and its place in the universe, a detailed look at the mind boggling size of the known universe and our humble place within it.
                            Supported with a power point display.</li>

                        <li>The human condition: This talk is a look at the modern world, what I see us getting right and wrong, its covers many aspects of life. What we consider success, how we interact, the pursuit of human happiness, our combative nature, many different things that will hopefully leave all in attendance feeling a renewed zest for life.

                <p>This book is a diverse read offering chapters covering multiple subjects, but all linked into the same theme. It explores many of the things we have been misinformed about in mainstream media, education and religion.
                    A chapter by chapter in depth look at various subjects that challenge what we think we know.<br></br>
                    It ultimately proposes an alternative way of thinking, and assessing what we have all been informed of through different platforms.
                    The book explores the author and some of the key things that have affected his life, guiding him to this point now where he wants to share some of his experiences. This includes his love of spirituality and the guidance that has been provided to him throughout his life.<br></br>
                    It's an often-humorous story with honest snippets from youth through to adulthood. It explores all the good and bad aspects of the human experience and his acceptance that it is all part of the journey.
                    The second chapter covers our recent technological boom. This explores the authors thoughts on how we have progressed so quickly over the last 100 years with a thought-provoking challenge as an explanation.<br></br>
                    A look at our history and all the many holes in what we have been informed about through education and religion, that frankly do not hold up now with science- throwing curve balls into our previous understanding of our past. The chapter covers such things as structural anomalies around the world, our true origins and the various differing species of humanity that have occupied this planet, and many more issues the author has found through his investigations.<br></br>
                    Through Government disclosure and personal accounts, the next chapter looks at the subject of ‘are we alone in this universe’?<br></br>
                    Starting way back in history and finishing right up to date it looks at the overwhelming evidence that would suggest we are not alone, from witness reports, abduction cases to crop circles. This chapter provides some compelling and fact-based evidence to support the authors ideas.
                    Following on from the previous chapter the author looks at our planet and its place in the universe, covering the mind-boggling numbers that are attached to the incredible size of the known universe, and our tiny insignificant place within it. It further highlights the facts presented in the previous chapter that discusses are we truly alone in a universe that is difficult to comprehend with its true and enormous size.
                    Moving away from historical information the author comes right up to date with a chapter about the modern world. He questions that have we really got it right? , and has life truly improved with all the stress and mental health issues being highlighted these days.<br></br>
                    An example being emails. Emails were meant to make life quicker and easier, yet in reality they have had a negative effect. Regardless of whether you work in an office or a building site, you have to factor into your daily life time to look at and respond to emails. It's something twenty-five years ago did not exist, but the world still worked, giving us something else to factor into what is not enough time in most people’s day. It was meant to improve and ease our existence, but does it?<br></br>
                    The final chapter tidies up other subjects missed in the book that would be discussed later, plus some detailed spiritual experience’s the author has had through his life that he wanted to share.
                    This book although is deep and meaningful, it is none the less easy to read and follow and certainly thought provoking.
                    It is a most enjoyable and recommended read.<br></br>
